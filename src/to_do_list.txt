Change Log
----------
v0.9.6  - Error counters save in EEPROM
        - Added button to reset counters
        - Added specific counter for resets due to web server failing
v0.9.5  - New variables for:
          + Min heap size seen since last boot
          + debugModeOn => Global logs ON/OFF
          + serialLogsOn => Serial logs ON/OFF
          + webLogsOn => Web logs ON/OFF
          + Web configuration/visualization support
        - Check connectivity and webserver and restart if needed
        - Forcing to free up heap memory in the event it's below a thresholds
          + Switch WiFi OFF/ON, WebServer OFF/ON, etc.
v0.9.4  - Minor bug fixing
v0.9.3  - Bug fixing ISS001
v0.9.2  - Init NTP-dependant modules after NTP initialization during normal execution:
          + EEPROM Time counters
        - Init wifi-dependant modules after wifi initialization during normal execution:
          + NTP, WebServer, WebSocket, MQTT, Upload server
v0.9.1  - WebSerial for log webconsole
        - OTA support
        - Web logs support
        - Time counters saved in EEPPROM
v0.9.0  - MQTT improvements
	        + Time on counters: year, moths, yesterday, today
v0.8.9  - First stable version with HA support


To do list for boiler relay control
-----------------------------------
- Troubleshooting
  + ISS002: Unexpected reboot
  + ISS003: Preventive reset are too often. RCA - seems to be related to the frequent WiFi disconnections due to the weak WiFi signal
  + ISS004: Web server KO afeter WiFi reconnection
- Time counters for boiler, similar to the heater ones
- Track time and last function executed when the Absolute min heap size ever seen is detected
- Track time and last function executed when the preventive software restart is executed
- Date in logs in addition to milliseconds
- Syslog support
- Led flashing to indicate situations: All good, no WiFi, WiFi connection, Gas detection

Done
--------
- detect thermostate on/off
- relay controls Rl1 and Rl2
- MQTT
- Send notification if gas leaks detected
- Update pandora with Thermostat activity
- Prevent from activating Relays in gas leak situation
- Error counters
  + WiFi connections
  + HTTP Cloud sample update
  + NTP sync
  + MQTT update
  + Uncontrolled resets
- MQTT Sensor
  + Boot count since last firmware update
  + Uncontrolled reset count
  + Other error counters
- Save in EEPROM durations of boiler burnings: today, yesterday, month, year
- Init NTP-dependant modules after NTP initialization during normal execution:
  + EEPROM Time counters
- Init wifi-dependant modules after wifi initialization during normal execution:
  + NTP, WebServer, WebSocket, MQTT, Upload server
- Variables for:
  + Min heap size seen since last boot
  + debugModeOn => Global logs ON/OFF
  + serialLogsOn => Serial logs ON/OFF
  + webLogsOn => Web logs ON/OFF
  + Web configuration/visualization support
- Check webserver and restart if needed
  + Init webserver-dependant modules after webserver initialization during normal execution:
    * WebSocket
- Forcing to free up heap memory in the event it's below a thresholds
  + Switch WiFi OFF/ON, WebServer OFF/ON, etc.
- Troubleshooting
  + ISS004: GAS interrupt trigered when THERMOSTAT interrupt is trigered too (and viceversa??). Fixed in 0.9.2
    Fix: it can't be avoided (due to static???), but GAS notificacion is done only if readings taken just right after GAS interrupt show GAS.
  + ISS001: Wrong info in logs from boot time - v0.9.3
    *   [printCurrentWiFi] - Signal strength (RSSI): e memory for RF calibration data => Use WiFi.SSID() instead of wifiNet.RSSI ?
    *   [printCurrentWiFi] - Encryption Type: 3
    *   [printCurrentWiFi] - WiFi Channel: E (%u) %s: %s: store calibration mac failed(0x%x)


  Discarded
  -------------
- Load time counters after NTP is synced if it wasn't during bootup.
  + Sum current time counters (if needed) to EEPROM ones and save them in EEPROM.
  ==> It's complex as it might impact today's and yesterday's counters, and different month and years.
