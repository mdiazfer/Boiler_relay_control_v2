- Troubleshooting
  + ISS004: GAS interrupt trigered when THERMOSTAT interrupt is trigered too (and viceversa??). Fixed in 0.9.2
    Fix: it can't be avoided (due to static???), but GAS notificacion is done only if readings taken just right after GAS interrupt show GAS.
  + ISS001: Wrong info in logs from boot time - v0.9.3
    *   [printCurrentWiFi] - Signal strength (RSSI): e memory for RF calibration data => Use WiFi.SSID() instead of wifiNet.RSSI ?
    *   [printCurrentWiFi] - Encryption Type: 3
    *   [printCurrentWiFi] - WiFi Channel: E (%u) %s: %s: store calibration mac failed(0x%x)
  + ISS002: Unexpected reboot
    * Fixed in v0.9.6. Not delete webServer nor webSocket objects
  + ISS003: Preventive reset are too often. RCA - seems to be related to the frequent WiFi disconnections due to the weak WiFi signal
    * Fixed in v0.9.6. Decreased WEBSERVER_MIN_HEAP_SIZE threshold 
  + ISS005: Web server KO after WiFi reconnection
    * Fixed in v0.9.6. Not delete webServer nor webSocket objects
  + ISS006: Side Col height for Graphs, Global Info, Basic Configuration, Console html pages
  + ISS007: HA takes doesn't refresh quickly Heater Status/Icon after IoT restart (ie. firmware upgred)
    * Fixed in v0.9.7 - MQTT HADiscovery packets are sent several times after bootup
  + ISS008: Randomly crash (heap getting off ??)
    * Fixed in v0.9.B. See IS0016 for the fix
  + ISS009: Web server not available randomly (connectivty lost ??)
    * Fixed in v0.9.B. See IS0016 for the fix
  + ISS010: Time On Today counter not saved in Yesterday when passing to the next day
    * Fixed in v0.9.9 - boiler variables were not updated in one_second_check_period function
  + ISS011: No subscripion on MQTT power Topic after enabling MQTT Power Measurements in web
    * Fixed in v0.9.9 - webServer.cpp
  + ISS012: Web server not available randomly and/or connectivy lost if boiler is ON (mqttmessages) and having active SSE clients (index.html)
    * Fixed in v0.9.B. See IS0016 for the fix
  + ISS013: Web server not available randomly and/or connectivy lost if there are both console clientes open and having active SSE clients (index.html)
    * Fixed in v0.9.B. See IS0016 for the fix
  + IS0014: boilerOnToday and boilerOnYesterday not saved correctly in EEPROM when changing day
    * boilerOnYesterday=0, boilerOnToday=88 => change day => boilerOnYesterday=88, boilerOnToday=0 => Reboot ==> boilerOnYesterday=0, boilerOnToday=198
    * Fixed in v0.9.B
  + IS0015: boiler and heater Time On Mounth counters not reset
    * Fixed in v0.9.B
  + IS0016: Some objects in the HA Discovery message are not recognized by HA in the very first packet sent after booting up
    * Fixed in v0.9.B
  + IS0017: New code to send HA Discovery MQTT message to reduce heap size and heap fragmentation
    * Fixed in v0.9.B
    * No String(...).c_str() usage 
    * Split HA Discovery messages into 8 functions
- Remove year from the MQTT topic for both previous and current years - v0.9.9
- Time counters for boiler, similar to the heater ones - v0.9.9
- Show Current Power (and Energy ?) in the index page - v0.9.9
- Deleted references to NTPResuming - v0.9.9
- Color grey Web boiler icon and Energy info if not powerMeasureEnabled - v0.9.9

  Discarded
  -------------
- Load time counters after NTP is synced if it wasn't during bootup.
  + Sum current time counters (if needed) to EEPROM ones and save them in EEPROM.
  ==> It's complex as it might impact today's and yesterday's counters, and different month and years.
